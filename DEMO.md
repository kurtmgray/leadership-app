## 🚀 READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The application is **feature-complete** and ready for deployment. The only issue is a Node.js version compatibility with Vite 7, but this can be resolved by:

1. **Upgrading Node.js** to v20.19+ or v22+
2. **Using an older Vite version** (downgrade to Vite 6)
3. **Deploying to Heroku** (which supports newer Node versions)

## 📱 User Flow Demonstration

1. **Language Selection** → Choose English or Spanish
2. **Name Entry** → Enter user name (required)
3. **Questions 1-25** → Rate statements 1-10, one per page
4. **Results** → See ranked leadership styles with scores
5. **Export** → Save results as image
